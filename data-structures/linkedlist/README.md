# Linked List

## What is a linked list

A linked list is a sequential list of  nodes that hold data which point to other nodes also containing data.

## Where are linked lists used?

- Used in many List, Queue & Stack implementations.

- Great for creating circular lists.
- Can easily model real world objects such as trains.
- Used in separate chaining which is present certain Hashtable implementations to deal with hashing collisions.
- Often used in the implementation of adjacency lists for graphs.

## Complexity Analysis

- Search: O(n)
- Insert at head: O(1)
- Insert at tail: O(1)
- Remove at head: O(1)
- Remove at tail: O(n)
- Remove in middle: O(n)
